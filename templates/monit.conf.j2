## Below you will find examples of some frequently used statements. For 
## information about the control file and a complete list of statements and 
## options, please have a look in the Monit manual.

## Global section
###############################################################################
##
## Start Monit in the background (run as a daemon):
#
set daemon  120           # check services at 2-minute intervals*/
     with start delay 120  # optional: delay the first check by 4-minutes (by 
#                           # default Monit check immediately after Monit start)
#
#
## Set syslog logging with the 'daemon' facility. If the FACILITY option is
## omitted, Monit will use 'user' facility by default. If you want to log to 
## a standalone log file instead, specify the full path to the log file
#
set logfile /var/log/monit.log #facility log_daemon                       
#
#
### Set the location of the Monit id file which stores the unique id for the
### Monit instance. The id is generated and stored on first Monit start. By 
### default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.id.
#
set idfile /var/.monit.id
#
### Set the location of the Monit state file which saves monitoring states
### on each cycle. By default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.state. If
### the state file is stored on a persistent filesystem, Monit will recover
### the monitoring state across reboots. If it is on temporary filesystem, the
### state will be lost on reboot which may be convenient in some situations.
#
# set statefile /var/.monit.state
#
## Set the list of mail servers for alert delivery. Multiple servers may be 
## specified using a comma separator. By default Monit uses port 25 - it is
## possible to override this with the PORT option.
#
# set mailserver mail.bar.baz,               # primary mailserver
#                backup.bar.baz port 10025,  # backup mailserver on port 10025
#                localhost                   # fallback relay
#
#
## By default Monit will drop alert events if no mail servers are available. 
## If you want to keep the alerts for later delivery retry, you can use the 
## EVENTQUEUE statement. The base directory where undelivered alerts will be 
## stored is specified by the BASEDIR option. You can limit the maximal queue
## size using the SLOTS option (if omitted, the queue is limited by space 
## available in the back end filesystem).
#
# set eventqueue
#     basedir /var/monit  # set the base directory where events will be stored
#     slots 100           # optionally limit the queue size
#
#
## Send status and events to M/Monit (for more informations about M/Monit 
## see http://mmonit.com/).
#
# set mmonit http://monit:monit@192.168.1.10:8080/collector
#
#
## Monit by default uses the following alert mail format:
##
## --8<--
## From: monit@$HOST                         # sender
## Subject: monit alert --  $EVENT $SERVICE  # subject
##
## $EVENT Service $SERVICE                   #
##                                           #
## 	Date:        $DATE                   #
## 	Action:      $ACTION                 #
## 	Host:        $HOST                   # body
## 	Description: $DESCRIPTION            #
##                                           #
## Your faithful employee,                   #
## Monit                                     #
## --8<--
##
## You can override this message format or parts of it, such as subject
## or sender using the MAIL-FORMAT statement. Macros such as $DATE, etc.
## are expanded at runtime. For example, to override the sender, use:
#
# set mail-format { from: monit@foo.bar }
#
#
## You can set alert recipients whom will receive alerts if/when a 
## service defined in this file has errors. Alerts may be restricted on 
## events by using a filter as in the second example below. 
#
# set alert sysadm@foo.bar                       # receive all alerts
# set alert manager@foo.bar only on { timeout }  # receive just service-
#                                                # timeout alert
#
#
## Monit has an embedded web server which can be used to view status of 
## services monitored and manage services from a web interface. See the
## Monit Wiki if you want to enable SSL for the web server. 
#
set httpd port 2812 #and
#     use address localhost  # only accept connection from localhost
     allow localhost        # allow localhost to connect to the server and
{% if monit_admin %}
     allow {{ monit_admin }}
{% endif %}
{% if http_proxy %}
    allow {{ http_proxy }}
{% endif %}
#     allow admin:monit      # require user 'admin' with password 'monit'
#     allow @monit           # allow users of group 'monit' to connect (rw)
#     allow @users readonly  # allow users of group 'users' to connect readonly
